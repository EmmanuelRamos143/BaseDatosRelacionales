  "rawNewScrapped": "A New York City correction officer was charged with murder on Thursday in the fatal shooting hours earlier of an 18-year-old man in the Bronx, the police said, with investigators exploring whether a toy weapon found at the scene had played a role in the killing. The officer charged in the case, Dion Middleton, was off duty when he shot the victim, Raymond Chaluisant, in the face near the intersection of the Cross Bronx Expressway and Morris Avenue around 1:35 a.m., the police said. Mr. Chaluisant was in a friend’s car on the way to a hospital when officers responding to a 911 call found him about a half-mile from the site of the shooting, the police said. He was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital and pronounced dead there, the police said. Officer Middleton, 45, was taken into custody later in the day at the Correction Department’s firing range, where he works, after investigators had scoured video footage from surveillance cameras in the area where the shooting occurred, officials said.",
